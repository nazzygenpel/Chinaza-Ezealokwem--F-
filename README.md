# Explain Version Control
Version control, also known as source control or revision control, is a system that manages changes to files and directories over time. It is primarily used in software development but can be applied to any set of files that undergo changes over time. The fundamental purpose of version control is to keep track of modifications to code or documents, enabling multiple contributors to work on a project concurrently while maintaining a complete history of changes.


# Explain differences between Git and GitHub
Git and GitHub are related but distinct tools that are commonly used in software development for version control and collaboration. Here are the key differences between Git and GitHub:

1. # Definition:

**Git** : Git is a distributed version control system (VCS) that allows developers to track changes in their codebase, collaborate with others, and manage different versions of their software.
**GitHub** : GitHub is a web-based platform that provides hosting for Git repositories. It enhances Git by offering additional features like a web-based graphical interface, collaboration tools, and a centralized platform for hosting and sharing repositories.

2. # Collaboration:

**Git** : Git itself doesn't inherently provide a platform for collaboration. Developers need to manually share their repositories and coordinate changes.
**GitHub** : GitHub facilitates collaboration by providing features like pull requests, which allow developers to propose changes, discuss them, and merge them into the main codebase. GitHub also supports issues, comments, and project boards, making it easier for teams to work together.

3. # Nature:

**Git**: Git is a command-line tool that runs locally on your computer. It provides version control functionalities, allowing you to track changes and manage your codebase on your machine.
**GitHub**: GitHub is a cloud-based platform that hosts Git repositories remotely. It acts as a central hub where developers can store, share, and collaborate on their Git repositories. GitHub provides a web-based interface for repository management and collaboration.

4. # Graphical Interface:

**Git** : Git is primarily a command-line tool, and its interface is text-based.
**GitHub** : GitHub provides a web-based graphical interface, making it more accessible for users who prefer a visual representation of their repositories. This includes features like branch visualization, commit history, and pull request management.

5. # Repository Hosting:

**Git**: With Git, you can create repositories on your local machine. It's entirely decentralized, and you can work locally without needing a connection to a server.
**GitHub**: GitHub provides a centralized platform for hosting Git repositories. Developers can push their local repositories to GitHub, making them accessible to others. GitHub also adds collaboration features like issue tracking, pull requests, and wikis.

In summary, Git is the version control system itself, while GitHub is a hosting platform built around Git. GitHub adds collaboration features and a web-based interface, making it a powerful tool for teams and open-source projects. Many other platforms, such as GitLab and Bitbucket, also provide similar services, but GitHub is one of the most widely used platforms.

# Explain the difference between git fetch and git pull.
git fetch is used to bring changes from a remote repository to your local repository without automatically merging them into your working directory. It allows you to inspect and decide when to integrate those changes. On the other hand, git pull does the same fetch operation but also automatically merges the changes into your current working branch, updating your working directory. The choice between them depends on whether you want more control over when to integrate changes (git fetch) or if you want to quickly bring in the changes and update your working directory (git pull).


# Explain in simple terms git rebase and the command for it 
Git rebase is a command used in Git version control to change the base commit of a branch. In simpler terms, it allows you to move or combine a series of commits to a new starting point, usually a more recent commit. git rebase as a way to integrate changes from one branch into another.
The command syntax is git rebase <new-base-branch>.


# Explain in simple terms git cherry-pick and the command for it 
Cherry-picking in Git is like picking specific changes from one branch and applying them onto another branch. It allows you to select and bring in specific commits from one branch to another. 
The basic syntax for the git cherry-pick command is: git cherry-pick <commit-hash>
